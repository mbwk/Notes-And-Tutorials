SSH Keys
--------

Using SSH keys avoids the need to log in every time GitHub needs authentication.

See [the GitHub help for SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

Remember to switch to SSH on GitHub before cloning a repo, so you will not have to
configure it manually later.
