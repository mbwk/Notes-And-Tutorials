Notes-And-Tutorials
===================

Public repo dedicated to holding my notes for things like build tools, language/library peculiarities, configurations, etc

About
-----

Basically, I have abnormally terrible memory. Having this public repo will make it so that I don't have to go Google searching for hours to find the same pages every few months, just so I can read them for 5 seconds and immediately remember everything.

Contributing
------------

If you find these useful, then great! If you see anything wrong with anything in this repo, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know.

Notes and guides for any mainstream language are welcome in this repo, though I will mostly be focusing on C++/Ruby stuff, because those are the languages I use the most.

Legal stuff
-----------

Any original code contained in this repo is BSD-2. Any code I've reference from another source (usually through a web link) belongs to the guy who wrote it.
