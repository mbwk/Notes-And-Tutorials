Notes-And-Tutorials
===================

Public repo dedicated to holding my notes for things like build tools,
language/library peculiarities, configurations, etc


About
-----

Basically, I have abnormally terrible memory. Having this public repo will make
it so that I don't have to go Google searching for hours to find the same pages
every few months, just so I can read them for 5 seconds and immediately
remember everything.


Contributing
------------

If you see anything wrong with anything in this repo, I'd appreciate it if
you'd let me know.

While this is a very Unix-centric repo, useful information on developing
for/on other platforms is very welcome.

Recent additions include examples and notes on my favourite build systems,
some config files I feel comfortable sharing with the world, and notes on
technologies that I am learning to use.


Legal
-----

With the obvious exception of any code I've not written myself (which I
always make note of, usually with a web link), all information contained within
this repo is released into the Public Domain (see LICENSE for an elaboration).
